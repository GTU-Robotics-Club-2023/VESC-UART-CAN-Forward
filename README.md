# VESC-UART-CAN-Forward
The <mark>***VESC-UART-CAN-Forward***</mark> library enables communication between two VESCs over the UART interface. It does not require multiple UARTs for communication between VESCs. The library provides a method to forward the UART messages over the CAN bus for inter-CAN communication between multiple VESCs.
